# Pizza Themed Hangman

Hangman Game that runs in a web browser using HTML and JavaScript. Pizza themed words are randomly selected and the user must guess the word correctly to win!

## How to Play

Using the keyboard, the user guesses a letter and the game will check to see if the chosen letter is in the unknown word. If the letter is correct it will be added in the blank spaces where it belongs. If the letter guess is incorrect, it is recorded as a wrong guess and the user loses a guess. The game is won once the user guesses the unknown word before running out of guesses.

The game will keep track of the wins and losses as each round is played.
